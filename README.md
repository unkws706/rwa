## Phemex Reviews

Phemex presents a mixed picture in user reviews across various platforms in 2025. On Trustpilot, the platform holds a 2.3-star rating, with users expressing concerns about customer support responsiveness and account access issues. Common complaints include difficulties with 2FA unbinding procedures, withdrawal delays, and account restrictions during security reviews. Some users report positive experiences with the trading interface and features, particularly praising the diverse order types and integration capabilities.

Professional reviews from industry publications like Coin Bureau and Milk Road highlight Phemex's competitive fee structure and comprehensive trading features, noting its evolution from a derivatives-only platform to a full-service crypto ecosystem. However, security concerns were raised following a hot wallet breach in early 2025, though the platform implemented compensation measures and enhanced security protocols. The platform's strengths include low trading fees starting at 0.01% for makers and advanced trading tools, while weaknesses center around customer service quality and past security incidents.
